    "text": "Blending Statistics and Computer Science\nWhy you may want to pursue a data science masters is if you want to blend together your knowledge of statistics and computer science to create useful projects. In my undergrad at the University of Toronto, I had previously only studied statistics and computer science in isolation. Having a minor in both subjects, I realized that each course I took would not have any “cross-contamination” of subjects. This was something that was missing in my undergrad. I would only learn algorithms in my computer science courses, or I would only learn hypothesis testing in my statistics courses. What is great about a data science masters is that you can work on projects that combine the best of both worlds. Instead of simply learning about statistical hypothesis testing, in many labs I had to implement and code it up myself! The learning you will have integrating the two subjects together is immense!\n\n\n\n\nData Science is in the Intersection of Statistics and Computer Science"

    "text": "Meeting Driven and Passionate People\nMeeting driven people focused on furthering their career prospects and learning more about data science is another reason why you might want to pursue the program. A data science masters is very selective, with programs like UBC having around a 10% acceptance rate. This selects the strongest applicants, and results in fellow students that are very competent and committed to learning all they can about data science. I’ve met many friends who have really helped me supplement my knowledge in data science, and have taught me many concepts that I wasn’t aware of before. What is great about a data science program is that it is not simply going to class and then going home - there is a camaraderie between the students. You will be in class with them from 9:30 AM to 4 PM almost every day, which means you’ll make close friends quickly after spending so much time with each other. If I can’t reiterate this enough, these classmates are some of the smartest people you will have ever met, meaning that they can help you with any questions you may have, and augment your learning by showing you concepts that weren’t even being taught in class.\n\n\n\n\nJoin a Hackathon with Your Fellow Students!"

    "text": "Opportunities to Go Above and Beyond\nBeing able to go above and beyond in your learning is one of my favorite aspects of the data science program. If you are the type of person that is perpetually curious and loves to fortify their own learning by going above and beyond, you will have plenty of opportunities to do that in the program. I noticed in high school and undergrad courses that usually the assignments will only have questions that all the students have to answer - without any extra questions for the most curious students. However, that is not the case for the data science program. You’ll have the opportunity to answer tough questions beyond the scope of what is expected of the students in every lab in the form of challenge questions. I think challenge questions are a unique way to really hone in and help you understand a certain topic that you are interested in. Finishing challenge questions shows that you have a commanding grasp on the topic at hand, and that you comprehensively understand the material. I would definitely recommend you to join a data science program if you like to satiate your curiosity and go the extra mile in learning about data science, because you’ll have plenty of opportunity to.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s Lots of Blackboards to Work on Tough Problems"

    "text": "If You Want to Coast Through\nNow, it can’t all be sunshine and rainbows, a data science masters may not be for you if you simply want a program where you want to coast by. Data science programs are tough, so you have to be on it, essentially throughout the whole program. Especially at a data science program like UBC’s, you will go through an entire course’s worth of content within four weeks, which means that missing even a day’s worth of content is missing more than 10% of the course! In high school, maybe you had a few courses that you didn’t like, so you just put the minimum possible effort into completing them. That isn’t really possible in a data science program. This is a program where you will have to work hard, so having a high interest in learning the content of the courses is a must.\n\n\n\n\nYou Probably Won’t Get By Sleeping Through Class!"

    "text": "If You Dislike Hands-On Learning\nFurthermore, a data science masters won’t be a good fit for you if you dislike hands-on work. In university, I noticed a lot of courses that I took would fall into two categories: courses that can be passed through rote memorization, and courses where you have to seriously understand the content and be able to do all the practice problems to pass. The courses in a data science masters definitely fall under the latter category. This is because in each course, there are weekly labs that take many hours to complete. Each lab has many questions where you put in the work of applying what you learned in class. Essentially, simply reading through the course textbook will not get you far - you’ll need a deep understanding of the concepts covered to be able to accurately finish the questions."
